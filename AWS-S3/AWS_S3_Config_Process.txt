So you want to use AWS S3 for storage, CDN and… The following serves me well when setting up a new site on S3. Hopefully it will be useful to you as well. Please let me know if something needs an adjustment or does not make sense.

## [Getting Started](#heading--getting-started)

You will need:
1. A self hosted Discourse instance with app.yml access. If you are hosted by one of the [commercial hosts] (http://needlink) they are probably managing your backups and CDNs.
2. AWS account
3. ???


## [Naming Strategy](#naming-strategy)

There are many places to make mistakes. Using a naming convention strategy that makes sense to you and perhaps others will help you with troubleshooting especially if you are configuring multiple Discourse instances.

* IAM user: your-iam-user
* Policy: s3-discourse-policy-your-iam-user
* Backups bucket: yourdomain-subdomain-backups
* Uploads bucket: yourdomain-subdomain-uploads
* Distribution CDNs: cdn-yourdomain-subdomain and  s3-yourdomain-subdomain-uploads

Optional: Configuration process bucket: a-origin-config-bucket

## [AWS Configuration](#aws-configuration)

Use the default settings in the AWS configuration pages unless instructed to do otherwise.

## [S3 Names, names, names](#s3-names)

* Discourse instance domain: subdomain.yourdomain.tld (subdomain.yourdomain.tld including www.yourdomain.tld)
* IAM user: yourdomain-subdomain (yourdomain-discourse, yourdomain-forum or Discourse in apex/root: yourdomain-tld-www )
* Policy for IAM user: s3-discourse-policy-yourdomain-subdomain
* Uploads bucket: yourdomain-subdomain-uploads Note: Don’t forget to set “Everyone (public access)” to “Read” in Bucket>Permissions: Access control list-(ACL) Access control list (ACL)-Grantee.
* Backups bucket: yourdomain-subdomain-backups
* Distribution CDNs: cdn-yourdomain-subdomain and s3-yourdomain-subdomain-uploads
* Configuration process bucket: a-origin-config-bucket

You can see how this strategy works in a real world example:

## [IAM Users](#iam-users)

1. Go to IAM > Users > Select "Create user" https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users/create
2. IAM > Users > Create user > Specify user details > User details > User name > Enter name i.e. your-iam-user > Select "Next"
4. IAM > Users > Create user > Set permissions > Permissions options > Select "Attach policies directly" > Select "Create policy" > Opens Create policy page (Alternatively the policy can be created first in Policies then selected when creating the user in "Permissions policies".)

7. IAM > Users > your-iam-user > Create access key > Access key best practices & alternatives > Select "Other" > Select "Next"
8. IAM > Users > your-iam-user > Create access key > Set description tag > Select "Create access key"
9. IAM > Users > your-iam-user > Create access key > Retrieve access keys > Safely save Access key and Secret access key for use in Discourse app.yml > Select "Done"

## [Policies](#policies)
1. Modify [s3-discourse-policy-your-iam-user.txt](https://github.com/WebSystems360/WorkingWithDiscourse/blob/main/AWS-S3/s3-discourse-policy-your-iam-user.txt)  with your IAM user name and bucket names.
2. Go to IAM > Policies > [Create policy](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/policies/create)
3. IAM > Policies > Create policy > Specify permissions > Policy editor > Select "JSON" in Policy editor > Copy policy from s3-discourse-policy-your-iam-user.txt and paste into JSON editor copying over existing JSON > Select "Next"
4. IAM > Policies > Create policy > Review and create > Policy details > Policy name > Enter Policy name i.e. s3-discourse-policy-your-iam-user > Select "Next"
5. Go to IAM Users : 4. IAM > Users > Create user to continue the create user process

## [Discourse Configuration](#discourse-configuration)

Make these changes in Discourse [Admin UI](https://discourseinstance.yourdomain.com/admin/)

**Backups Settings**  /admin/backups/settings
1. Maximum backups > Enter the number of backups to keep locally
2. Backup with uploads > Select "Include uploads in scheduled backups. Disabling this will only backup the database."

**S3 Settings** /admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=S3
1. S3 use CDN URL for all uploads > Select “Use CDN URL for all the files uploaded to s3 instead of only for images.” (Discourse ships deselected)

### [Edit Config (app.yml) Unbranded URLs](#edit-config-unbranded)

Edit the app.yml making the changes below for branded URLs or unbranded Cloudfront URLs.

### [Discourse Unbranded URLs](#discourse-unbranded-urls)

Use this for unbranded Cloudfront distributions. Your DISCOURSE_S3_REGION might be different.
DISCOURSE_CDN_URL: https://amazonassigned.cloudfront.net

**S3 storage config (unbranded)**

```
## S3 storage config
DISCOURSE_USE_S3: true
DISCOURSE_S3_REGION:  us-east-1
DISCOURSE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: key obfuscated
DISCOURSE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: key obfuscated
DISCOURSE_S3_CDN_URL: https://amazonassigned.cloudfront.net
DISCOURSE_S3_BUCKET: your-bucket-name-uploads
DISCOURSE_S3_BACKUP_BUCKET: your-bucket-name-backups
DISCOURSE_BACKUP_LOCATION: s3
```

### [Discourse Branded URLs](#discourse-branded-urls)

**DNS Configuration**

If you prefer to use yourdomain.com based URLs for the CDNs you need to make some DNS changes and adjust your CDN URLs.

**Note:** Don’t forget to add discourse-cdn.yourdomain.com and s3-cdn.yourdomain.com as a domain name in “Alternate domain names” for their respective Cloudfront distributions.

DNS config if you want to use domain branded Cloudfront distributions.

**DISCOURSE_CDN_URL**

```
Existing record:	A   discourseinstance.yourdomain.com   instance ip  Note: This is the existing Discourse install ip.
New record:		A   discourse-cdn-cloudfront.yourdomain.com   instance ip
New record: 		CNAME discourse-cdn.yourdomain.com  -->   amazonassigned.cloudfront.net
```

**DISCOURSE_S3_CDN_URL**

```
New record:		CNAME s3-cdn-cloudfront.yourdomain.com  -->   amazonassigned.cloudfront.net
New record: 	CNAME  s3-cdn.yourdomain.com  -->   s3-cdn-cloudfront.yourdomain.com
```

## [Edit Config (app.yml) Branded URLs](#edit-config-branded)

Once the DNS changes are complete you can edit your app.yml making the changes below.

Change DISCOURSE_CDN_URL and/or DISCOURSE_S3_CDN_URL if you are using domain CNAMES for the Cloudfront distribution (amazonassigned.cloudfront.net).

DISCOURSE_CDN_URL: https://discourse-cdn.yourdomain.com

## S3 storage config (branded)

```
## S3 storage config
DISCOURSE_USE_S3: true
DISCOURSE_S3_REGION:  us-east-1
DISCOURSE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: key obfuscated
DISCOURSE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: key obfuscated
DISCOURSE_S3_CDN_URL: https://s3-cdn.yourdomain.com
DISCOURSE_S3_BUCKET: your-bucket-name-uploads
DISCOURSE_S3_BACKUP_BUCKET: your-bucket-name-backups
DISCOURSE_BACKUP_LOCATION: s3
```

## [Additional Config Edits (app.yml)](#additional-config-edits)

Regardless of which approach you use, branded or Cloudfront URLs, you will need the after_assets_precompile section below to ensure things stay updated during subsequent rebuilds.

```
hooks:
after_code:
- exec:
cd: $home/plugins
cmd:
- git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git
-you may have more plugins
after_assets_precompile:
- exec:
cd: $home
cmd:
- sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets
- sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:expire_missing_assets
```

Rebuild your instance with  ./launcher rebuild app

After ./launcher rebuild app completes successfully do these rakes.

```
./launcher enter app

rake posts:rebake
rake uploads:migrate_to_s3
rake posts:rebake_uncooked_posts

rake s3:upload_assets
rake s3:expire_missing_assets
```

If the rakes complete without errors then you are good to go. Move onto configuring Lifecycle rules for your-bucket-name-backups.

On some sites the initial rebuild will fail with an error relating to s3:upload_assets. If this happens comment out or remove

after_assets_precompile section:

```
  after_assets_precompile:
      - exec:
          cd: $home
          cmd:
            - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:upload_assets
            - sudo -E -u discourse bundle exec rake s3:expire_missing_assets
```

and run ./launcher rebuild app again. Then run “rake s3:upload_assets” and “rake s3:expire_missing_assets”.

If both of the rakes complete without errors then re-add or uncomment the after_assets_precompile section, rebuild again and do the all the rakes listed above.

If either of the rakes give an error or the rebuild fails again you have something wrong in your app.yml, AWS S3 configs and/or DNS records. Happy hunting! :slight_smile:
